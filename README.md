**Link Shortener with MEAN Stack**

This is the 3rd link shortener repo that I'm creating. The previous ones are the following:

- [Link Shortener with Django](https://github.com/aerabi/link-shortener)
- [Link Shortener with Nest.js and Redis](https://github.com/aerabi/link-shortener-js)

Based on these two repos, Ajeet and I wrote two blog posts that were published on Docker's website:

- [How to Build and Deploy a Django-based URL Shortener App from Scratch](https://www.docker.com/blog/how-to-build-and-deploy-a-django-based-url-shortener-app-from-scratch/)
- [How to Build and Deploy a URL Shortener Using TypeScript and Nest.js](https://www.docker.com/blog/how-to-build-and-deploy-a-url-shortener-using-typescript-and-nest-js/)

This idea for this repo is the same. This repo will host a similar project that will be the base for the next Docker blog post.

## How to Contribute

I have created a few issue that need to be done in order to have a full functioning link shortener. You can confer the aforementioned repos and blog posts to fix them. The contributors will be mentioned on the end result.
